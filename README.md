> [!WARNING]

## Introduction

This is one of the first themes that is made exclusively for [Vencord/Vesktop](https://github.com/Vencord/Vesktop/releases).

Since Discord's update to the new Chromium version, this theme now also supports the regular [Vencord](https://vencord.dev).

## Features

- High customizability:
  - **_Add a pre-made Nitro theme or background of your choice_** and adjust the brightness, blur as well as transparency
  - **Client global accent** using the HSL scheme
  - A **second accent color** to highlight important elements and add style
  - **Modules** (user panel, member list, guild list etc.) that can be flipped around
  - Adjustable **chat bubble and status colors**
  - Adjustable **primary and code font**
  - **Add a custom name on the titlebar** to make the layout more personal
- **A revamped look** for many elements, including profile panels and modals, Spotify controls, guild list and many more!
- **Compatibility and quality of life changes** for many of Vesktop's existing plugins
- Several **_add-ons_** are available separately in the `modular.theme.css` file
- Active support (to my ability)
- Some of the elements of this theme are available separately as snippets. Check them out [here](https://github.com/SEELE1306/CSS-Snippets).
