> The theme has been largely rewritten. Please update to the latest version to ensure functionality.

## Introduction

This is one of the first themes that is made exclusively for [Vencord/Vesktop](https://github.com/Vencord/Vesktop/releases).

Since Discord's update to the new Chromium version, this theme now also supports the regular [Vencord](https://vencord.dev).

## Features

- High customizability:
  - Customizable base, accent and Discord colors (red, yellow, green, etc.)
  - Modules (user panel, member list, guild list etc.) that can be flipped around
  - Adjustable primary and code font
  - Add a custom name on the titlebar to make the layout more personal
- A revamped look for many elements, including profile panels and modals, Spotify controls and many more!
- Compatibility and quality of life changes for many of Vesktop's existing plugins
- Active support (to my ability)
- Some of the elements of this theme are available separately as snippets. Check them out [here](https://github.com/SEELE1306/CSS-Snippets).
